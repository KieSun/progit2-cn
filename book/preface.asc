== 前言

欢迎阅读Pro Git（第2版）。
第一版出版已有4年。
从那时起已有很多改进，当然很多关键内容没变。
尽管因为 Git 核心团队极好的保持着向后兼容，大部分核心命令和概念在今天依然有效，仍然出现一些重要的增强和 Git 周边社区变化。
本书第二版的目的是更新内容以指明这些变化，以使更能够帮助新用户。

写第一版时， Git 还是相对难操作，勉强能用的工具，供高级黑客们使用。
刚在某些社区开始流行，但是还没达到今天这种无处不在的程度。
从那时至今，几乎所有的开源社区已经采用了它。
在 Windows 支持，在所有平台上数量激增的图形用户界面，在IDE支持和商业应用，这些方面 Git 都取得了显著的进步。
4年前的 Pro Git 全未涉及。
这个版本的主要目标之一是触及 Git 社区的所有这些新领域变化。

The Open Source community using Git has also exploded.
When I originally sat down to write the book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the first version out), I had just started working at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub.
At the time of publishing there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us working on it.
As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10 millionth hosted project, with nearly 5 million registered developer accounts and over 230 employees.
Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when I sat down to write the first edition.

I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git which I was never very comfortable with.
I didn't much like that I was writing what I felt was essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it.
While I still don't love that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable.
Instead of an example of Git hosting, I have decided to turn that part of the book into more deeply describing what GitHub is and how to effectively use it.
If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which Git host you decide to use for your own code.

The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions. Most of the examples in the book have been changed to HTTP from SSH because it's so much simpler.

It's been amazing to watch Git grow over the past few years from a relatively obscure version control system to basically dominating commercial and open source version control. I'm happy that Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market that is both quite successful and fully open source.

I hope you enjoy this updated edition of Pro Git.
