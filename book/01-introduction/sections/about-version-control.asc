=== 关于版本控制

(((version control)))
什么是“版本控制”？我为什么要关心它呢？
版本控制是一种记录一个或若干文件内容变化，以便将来查阅特定版本修订情况的系统。
在本书所展示的例子中，我们仅对保存着软件源代码的文本文件作版本控制管理，但实际上，你可以对任何类型的文件进行版本控制。

如果你是位图形或网页设计师，可能会需要保存某一幅图片或页面布局文件的所有修订版本（这或许是你非常渴望拥有的功能）。采用版本控制系统（VCS）是个明智的选择。
有了它你就可以将某个文件回溯到之前的状态，甚至将整个项目都回退到过去某个时间点的状态，你可以比较文件的变化细节，查出最后是谁修改了哪个地方，从而找出导致怪异问题出现的原因，又是谁在何时报告了某个功能缺陷等等。
使用版本控制系统通常还意味着，就算你乱来一气把整个项目中的文件改的改删的删，你也照样可以轻松恢复到原先的样子。
但额外增加的工作量却微乎其微。

==== 本地版本控制系统

(((version control,local)))
许多人习惯用复制整个项目目录的方式来保存不同的版本，或许还会改名加上备份时间以示区别。
这么做唯一的好处就是简单。不过坏处也不少：
有时候会混淆所在的工作目录，一旦弄错文件丢了数据就没法撤销恢复。

为了解决这个问题，人们很久以前就开发了许多种本地版本控制系统，大多都是采用某种简单的数据库来记录文件的历次更新差异。

其中最流行的一种叫做 rcs，现今许多计算机系统上都还看得到它的踪影。
甚至在流行的 Mac OS X 系统上安装了开发者工具包之后，也可以使用 rcs 命令。
它的工作原理基本上就是保存并管理文件补丁（patch）。文件补丁是一种特定格式的文本文件，记录着对应文件修订前后的内容变化。所以，根据每次修订后的补丁，rcs 可以通过不断打补丁，计算出各个版本的文件内容。

==== Centralized Version Control Systems

(((version control,centralized)))
The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems.
To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed.
These systems, such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce, have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. (((CVS)))(((Subversion)))(((Perforce)))
For many years, this has been the standard for version control.

This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs.
For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing.
Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what; and it's far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.

However, this setup also has some serious downsides.
The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents.
If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they're working on.
If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven't been kept, you lose absolutely everything – the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines.
Local VCS systems suffer from this same problem – whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.

==== Distributed Version Control Systems

(((version control,distributed)))
This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in.
In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository.
Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.
Every checkout is really a full backup of all the data.

Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project.
This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren't possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.
